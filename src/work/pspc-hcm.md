Humanize pay project aims to apply Human-Centered Design (HCD) to enhance the [HR-to-Pay](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/remuneration-compensation/services-paye-pay-services/strategie-integree-integrated-strategy-eng.html) process for Government of Canada employees, focusing on service efficiency and empathy-led user experience. Utilizing behavioral insights, service blueprints, and collaborative groups, it aims to create a more efficient and accessible digital service that reduces cost and effort associated with current process blockers, improve transaction timeliness and optimize the pay process for end-users as well as pay adminsitration for Pay Center.
