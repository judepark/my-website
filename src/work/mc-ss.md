Developed [digital tools](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/measurement-canada/en/inspections) aimed at ensuring accuracy and compliance for inspectors to complete Electricity and Gas inspections in accordance to measurement laws, all online. This project encompassed an unconventional design approach, addressing challenges in transitioning ownership to the government, and included responsibilities such as enforcing measurement laws. The efforts led to the establishment of new [Service Standards](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/measurement-canada/en/mandate/service-standards) for Measurement Canada.
