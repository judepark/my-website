A [strategy plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/corporate/transparency/departmental-plan/2024-2025-plan/at-glance.html) to establish a User Experience (UX) function within Public Services and Procurement Canada, starting with the Human Resources Branch as a pilot branch. The plan involved change management initiatives to integrate UX practices, the creation of mechanisms for a participant retainer network, and the development of operations for continuous research with end-users. Additionally, the plan focused on standardizing user research and design practices to ensure consistent and effective outcomes across all initiatives at the branch.
