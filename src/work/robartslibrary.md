 [Design project](https://github.com/judepark/Robarts-Library-Kiosk-Service) with University of Toronto's John P. Robarts Research Library in the heart of Toronto to transform their [kiosk service](https://36gd76.axshare.com/home.html).

###### Experience map to understand the complete experience of the user behaviour and journey.
<br/>



Creating the experience map and full-service UI for kiosk stations involved meticulous user research and analysis. We conducted over 20 user interviews, observations and task-based research that analyzed user needs, pinpointed pain points, and visualized their journey, offering vital insights for improvement. Personas and low-fidelity sketches were also developed.

The result: Increased user engagement, cost reduction, reduced staff dependency, and improved navigation. The kiosk stations optimized the journey from entry to exit, elevating the way-finding experience in the library for over 18,000 daily visitors.

Creating the experience map and full-service UI for kiosk stations involved meticulous user behaviour research and analysis. We conducted over 20 user interviews, with 5$ starbucks cards as incentives (we would have done more if we had the budget) observations and task-based research that analyzed user needs, pinpointed pain points, and visualized their journey, offering vital insights for improvement. Personas and low-fidelity sketches were also developed. This project honed my user research and design skills, stressing the improtance of bridging digital design with real-world user interactions to transform the service for over 18,000 patrons who visit the libary every day.
