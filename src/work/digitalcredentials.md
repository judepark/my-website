The [National Digital Trust Proof of Concept](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/atb-ventures-to-help-canadian-government-with-its-digital-id-efforts/473393#:~:text=Innovation%2C%20Science%20and%20Economic%20Development,issue%20and%20verify%20digital%20credentials) was the first national initiative to experiment with digital credentials technology to facilitate the transition to digital transactions. By leveraging emerging technologies like Verifiable Credentials, the project developed a centralized pilot service for select Canadian businesses and organizations to issue and verify digital documents to compete in the [global market](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/acts-regulations/en/forward-regulatory-plan/targeted-regulatory-review).
