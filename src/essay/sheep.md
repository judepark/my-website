The room is bright and yellow chandeliers are shining like diamonds in the sky. Statue suits and beautiful gowns, the colours blinding me. Masked strangers in tuxedoes serving butter tarts, with sugary pink champagne. I am accepting an award. I am in the centre of it all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He comes to me, in the middle of the night. Knocking at my door so loudly I quickly open it in fear of waking up the neighbours. He is soaking wet from the rain. He glares down at me, the tears merging into the rain in his hair. He looks absolutely desperate. Damaged goods, exactly up to my satisfaction. “I’m sorry.” He utters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My teeth is hurting, it’s so sweet. We run to the forest to play manhunt. We cross rivers, the ice is very thin where the water is still running. Lines of tides hurrying to join the water against the icy rocks, by tomorrow it will surely freeze over completely. I drop my slushy. The red dyes the ice, it looks like crystallized blood. We run to the island.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He keeps his arm over my shoulders, even while he is eating. He is laughing at my timid attempts to eat, but I barely do, I am much too shy. He says I’m tougher than his friends, I take pain like a man. He slams my back, so hard that food comes flying out, making me choke and cough. They laugh, the aloof giants. We will get dessert afterwards. I feel safe and protected. I look up and observe these strange giants around me, wondering if I will ever get that big.

I am on a plane. My ears pop miles above ground. I imagine what exciting adventures await me at landing. My backpack is a brown pug, and I slit his throat to take out my secretly stashed brownie. I politely ask a pretty stewardess for a glass of milk. She smiles so beautifully, I am smitten for life. A book and a brownie, and a glass of milk. My airplane ritual. My feet tap against each other in giddy excitement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sebastian the red crab is soaking up the sun beside me. My mom is waiting for me to finish collecting the little flowers in the cracks on the road. I run up to her. One hand in her hand, the other with Sebastian, we walk to McDonalds. I tell her I plan on playing all day in the park with my friend. She hands me a loonie for the ice cream truck later. I will wait for that carousel song that summons children like ants to honey on a hot day. I hold up the coin to the sun.

Counting sheep never worked for me. 
I just get lost in their soft white fur.
