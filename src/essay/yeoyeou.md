"You can tell someone has money or not by how they drive."

My sister was driving in Seoul and complaining about the drivers.

"It's usually the people who drive shitty cars who are the most aggresive. Unlike people who drive BMWs or expensive cars, these drivers never gives you way."

I had never noticed it before. This was before I started learning how to drive. But I thought about it.

"Maybe it's not that they're poor, but that they don't have 여유."

<br/> 

There's a korean word that describes the state of having enough: 여유 (yeoyeoyu /jʌ̹ju/). To have yeoyeou, is to have the luxury of time and things to spare. 

Like many, I know the shame of not having enough. Like not having the money to buy what you need, or not having something in your life that most others seem to have, be it health, happiness, or parents. 

I used to think the tightness in my chest whenever we got a knock on the door was normal. Not normal in the sense that everyone else felt it, but it was normal to me. I knew it wasn't normal that I went hungry at lunch when other kids got to eat. But it was my normal.

The problem was after adulthood. Even after I silently joined the rest of society and became difficult to tell apart. The tightness persisted.

It came not as often, but accompanied with anger. Sometimes all at once. 

I think a lot of the anger, violence and harm in the world can be attributed to people believing they do not have enough. It comes from a pack fending for their food in an arena with not enough food.

What is enough in a world where there is seemingly infinite amount? What is enough in a world where you are instantly exposed to abundance at a flicker of a finger? Whether we have enough or not, we are aware of others who have more than us. We operate with a scarcity mindset.

So we have a choice, to either continue on the road of rage being unhappy all the time, or to redefine what it means to have enough.

Perhaps my sister is right, and the people with less, who are aware they are with less, tends to be worse drivers. 

But I hope to not be one of them when I drive. I would rather shift my definition of enough, than show my fangs. I would rather accept what I have is enough, than lash out in the arena. 

In my experience, people are rude wherever you go anyways. Almost as if it's not about what they have or do not have. They are operate in desperation, as if there is not enough.



<!-- 

I remember one night, waiting for a bus at night after multiple shifts and being exhausted. I was angry. So very angry. No one in the world was angrier than me that night under that street light.  

That arena would would be more violent when the people inside know of the existence of more outside.
