"If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design."
- Ralf Speth

Too often in government, UX is treated as a checkbox to report up that some form of user experience work has been done as a requirement. Unfortunately, this means that no proper investigation into the users and their feedbacks have been incorporately into the project lifecycle.

Project or product management nowadays emphasizes user experience more than ever before. While this is generally considered to be a good thing, since it implies digital products and services are more user friendly, the reality is that many project leads do not properly understand user experience and therefore end up treating it like a checkbox.

The UX checkbox is one of the most dangerous attitudes a project lead could have ever regarding their project.

Usually what happens, due to external pressures to create user-friendly products, is that the leaders hear about user experience and think yeah that sounds like a great thing to add to my project! Everyone else is doing it! User Experience means you think about the user's experience right? Right on! Lets hire a UX professional contrator to bring a more User Experience aspect to our project.

What they end up doing is treating UX as a simple checkbox.

The checkbox they have in their mind looks like this:

When really, it should look like this:

Too often, UX is treated as a singular checkbox in the project. We hired a UX person on this project, therefore we can ensure this prodcut is UX-friendly.

This is not true!

When we treat these ux checklists, or targets in projects, we are dehumanizing the process of actually thinking about people.

solving issues involves facing your won demons, it is uncomfortable and we don't have the self reflective tools to navigate that - so everything turns into lip service

another hazard about assumptions: Assuming that someone else has taken care of it (e.g. when using a tool/template from someone else. even from a company dedicated to inclusive design! they may have gaps!)

There actualy isn't a lot of people out there who truly understands accessibility, because most designers are able bodied



Explaining the differences between UXR and POR

Introduction
In the world of public service, there are countless ways to approach a problem. At times, these methods can sound so similar that they're easy to confuse with one another. User experience (UX) design and public opinion research are two such topics that many people mistakenly believe overlap when in reality they have very distinct differences. Whether you work in UX or public opinion research—or both—it's important to understand the distinctions between these fields. So read on to learn what each method has to offer, how it differs from the other, and how your organization can benefit from using them together.

UX works best when it's on the front end of the process, before building begins
As a UX designer, you're always asking questions. What does the user want? How will they use the product? What does the business need from this product? Who are we designing for, and what do they need to accomplish with our product or service?

These are the right questions to ask. But it's not enough to think about these things in isolation; you also have to understand how they interact with each other. UX design is a process of synthesis—you're taking all of these different variables and coming up with something that works well for everyone involved.

UX doesn't always mean wireframes and visual design
UX is a process, not a deliverable. UX isn't necessarily visual design or wireframes.

User experience design is a way of thinking, not a specific tool. It's the act of trying to make things easier to use and understand by understanding your users and their needs. User experience designers turn their observations into practical solutions that improve the overall user experience (UX).

UX design is a process, not a department. It's important to remember that the term "UX" is not limited to just one function or activity, but rather it spans across all areas of product development and implementation. UX can be applied to any process in which users interact with technology or products—from marketing materials, sales processes, and customer service interactions to specific features such as search functionality or payments systems.

This means that UX isn't just about design; it also encompasses business strategy and technical implementation. In fact, many companies have found success by integrating UX teams into existing departments (e.g., sales) rather than creating new ones altogether (e.g., "The User Experience Team").

Public opinion research usually include focus groups
Focus groups are a common tool used by UX designers to collect feedback on their designs. In these sessions, people come together (usually in a room) and discuss things related to the topic at hand. For example, if you want to find out how people feel about your website's home page, you could run a focus group with people who have visited the site before and ask them what they think of it.

Focus groups are also used in public opinion research for surveying broader topics than just websites or products: for example, events like elections or political movements. A good way to think of this is when there's an event like an election happening, researchers will survey different types of voters about their opinions on candidates or ideas related to that election—this helps them understand why their candidate won/lost and what voters' views on certain issues were during that campaign period

Public opinion research focuses on being accurate and representative, rather than being quick
POR focuses on getting the right answers. In public opinion research, accuracy is key. When you conduct a survey or formative research session, you want to make sure that all of your questions are answered by the right people in order to get good data out of them. This may mean spending more time finding someone who matches your target audience or prioritizing certain demographics over others when it comes to recruitment (for example, targeting teens instead of senior citizens).

Make sure you're getting representative answers

In any type of survey or interview process, it's important that the participants reflect their intended audience as accurately as possible. For example: if the participants are supposed to be 18-24 year olds but there are more men than women participating in an event hosted by an organization primarily geared toward women's interests—or vice versa—then this could skew results and cause problems later down the line when analyzing findings from your research efforts.

Public opinion surveys are usually created in collaboration with an expert from the topic you are covering, who can help keep the questions unbiased and make sure that you're asking the right questions to get at the answers you actually care about. For example, if your survey is about food preferences and your expert happens to be a nutritionist, she can make sure that all of your questions are based on healthful eating.

These two fields have similar goals and may even offer solutions to each other's challenges
UX and public opinion research can be somewhat similar. In both fields, the goal is to understand users. These two fields also have a lot to offer each other. For example, UX could help public opinion researchers by providing more accurate data through better testing that doesn't involve any biased human interpretation of results. Public opinion researchers could benefit from understanding how people interact with products or services and what their emotional responses are (if they even have one).

Public opinion researchers need to create surveys that are easy for a wide range of people to answer quickly and accurately, while still being able to get the information they need out of them as accurately as possible. Users may not always give honest answers when filling out surveys because they don't want others knowing about themselves or their habits (especially if those habits aren't socially acceptable), so it's important for these kinds of professionals to make sure that whatever questions they ask fit within certain demographics before releasing them into the wilds of our society at large - otherwise their findings may not translate well when applied back into real life situations later down the road!

Conclusion
The goals of user experience (UX) design and public opinion research may overlap, but there are crucial distinctions between the two. A key way to think about it is that UX design has a much more specific focus: just one person. It's easy for you to forget that by asking one question or making one decision, you can change the whole experience for someone using your product or service. In this case, too much information can be a bad thing. Just remember how we started this article: UX designers need to ask the right questions in order to make their products usable by as many people as possible
