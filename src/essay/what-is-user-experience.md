### Introduction:

This presentation serves as an introduction to what user experience is, and it's current role in the context of public service. The field of design, technology and innovation is constantly evolving, but the role of understanding the users, the customers, the clients remains critical in successful service delivery. 

<br/>

### What is User Experience?

User Experience (UX) covers the aspects related to how people experience a company, their services and their products. In the context of the Government of Canada: **UX is the experience of Canadians and beyond when they are using government services and products.**

I like to compare a good user experience to having a good tour guide. Let's imagine, that you just entered a brand new museum in town, and you don't know where to start. Imagine there is a tour guide with you, who shows you around the exhibit, showing you all the pieces that is relevant and of interest to you, step by step, in the most efficient path possible so that you can access when you want access. Taht is what a good user experience should feel like, for every government services. Through evidence-based research and carefully placed design decisions, the services we offer should feel like there is an invisible tour guide that ensures you have access to the right information when you need it.

The purpose of UX in government is to ensure our products and our services are doing what they are intend it to, for the benefit of the Canadians and beyond.

### How UX Helps with Projects

The work of understanding the users can look at many different aspects to help out a project:

- Looking at quantiative data and qualidative data related to user experience of a product or service
- Assess the quality of usability in a Technology
- Leveraging Human Psychology to understand User Behaviours 
- Navigating Cognitive biases and barriers to access, fairness, equity between a service and the people
- Aims to increase qualitative values or beliefs like Royalty
- Trustworthiness of an organization in the minds of people
- holistic experience individuals have with a company, its services, and products.
- interactions for touchpoints
- The purpose of UX in government is clear: to ensure services fulfill their intended purpose effectively. UX evaluates usability, leverages human psychology, addresses cognitive biases, and fosters trustworthinessâ€”all to enhance the user journey

### Why It Matters

> **"If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design."**

There are countless examples of organizations suffering losses of millions of dollars if not billions due to bad design, or bad processes. Through those case studies we have learned that it is way more expensive to retroactively fix bad design, than investing the time and resources at the beginning to ensure you have a good design (or close to it). **Design matters because it directly impacts the ability to access the services that people need - and it's more cost effective to get it right the first time.**

<br/>

### What UX is Not

Sometimes, it is more helpful to explain what UX is by talking about what it is not. There's a tendency to simplify what UX is, by looking at it only from visual components. But **UX focuses on function, while artists focus on the expressions of emotions.** A truly good UX designer should not impart any of their individual biases or expressions or opinions into what they they design. Often times, companies will hire me and ask me to "make their website pretty" but that is not my job. 

UX focuses on function, so we ask questions like: 

- "Is the product working as intended?"
- "Is the service doing the job it's suppose to do?"
- "Why is it not doing that?"
- "How can design can fix that?"

Design decisions should be based on user data. When you look at the history of UX, though the term itself was coined only in 1993 by Don Norman, the discipline itself was heavily influenced, and born out of traditional architecture: With the explosion of the web and digital, and with all this building of digital spaces and experiences online, UX became more prominent. But the original intention and value has stayed the same. At the end of the day, **UX is about making things work**, not only pretty. What good is a pretty building if it's going to collapse?

### Misconceptions about UX in Gov

Despite its importance, misconceptions about UX persist. Especially in public service. These are some [misconceptions](https://judepark.com/essay/ux-in-gov) about UX that I heard throughout my career:

- "UX is just about making things look pretty."
- "UX is only about the technology or the interface."
- "UX is only relevant for the private sector."
- "UX in government is only about improving websites and forms."
- "Governments cannot prioritize UX due to budget constraints."
- "UX should be the responsiblity of a sole designer."
- "UX is a checkmark exercise"

UX focuses on service, functionality, and the holistic experience; not merely about the visual aesthetics or the technology. Contrary to popular belief, UX isn't solely relevant to the private sector. It is arguably more critical in government where services are irreplaceable. UX should not be a checkmark exercise; it requires strategic investment and genuine expertise.

### Final Thoughts

Doing UX "right" can be complex and you need the right senior leadership who understands the size of effort and quality of work that goes into it. There needs to be a fundamental talent attraction and managmenet transformation to maintain UX as a priority in governments through policy changes.
 
As a government, we should rely on data to make informed decisions and understading the user experience is a critical piece to making sure our policies address the right needs and pain points.

The act of exploring questions about the user experience and answering them, anticipating people's behaviors through data and evidence - that is the work of user experience research and design. And we need the support and resources in talent, tools, policies, processes to do it right for Canadians and beyond.
