### Introduction:

What is user experience, and what is its current role in public service? The field of design, technology and innovation is constantly evolving, but the role of understanding the people that rely on your services (eg. users, customers, clients, citizens, ect.) remains critical in successfully delivering good services.

<br/>

### What is User Experience?

User Experience (UX) covers the aspects related to how people experience a company, their services and their products. In the context of the Government of Canada: **UX is the experience of the people when they are using government services and products.**

With the explosion of the web and digital, and government services becoming more online, it became crucial to understand the user experience of the people who use government services.

I often say, UX was always important for governments, even before

As a user experience designer, I often say: "I try to create good user experience for people who use government services." 

To define what a good user experience is like, I like to compare a good user experience to having a good tour guide. Let's imagine that you just entered a brand new museum in town, and you don't know where to start. Imagine there is a tour guide with you, who shows you around the exhibit, showing you all the pieces that is relevant and of interest to you, step by step, in the most efficient path possible. Taht is what a good user experience should feel like, for every government services. Through evidence-based research and carefully placed design decisions, the services we offer should feel like there is an invisible tour guide that ensures you have access to the right information when you need it.

The purpose of understanding UX in government is to ensure our products and our services are doing what they are intended to, for the benefit of the Canadians and beyond.

### Why It Matters

> **"If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design."**

There are countless examples of organizations suffering losses of millions of dollars if not billions due to bad design. It is way more expensive to retroactively fix bad design, than investing the time and resources at the beginning to ensure you have a good design (or close to it). At the end of the day: **Design matters because it directly impacts people's ability to access the services that they need - and it's more cost effective to get it right the first time.**

<br/>

### What UX is Not

Sometimes, it is more helpful to explain what UX is by talking about what it is not. There's a tendency to simplify what UX is, by only focusing on its visual or artistic values. However, **UX focuses on function.**

Focusing on questions like: 

- "Is the product working as intended?"
- "Is the service doing the job it's suppose to do?"
- "Why is it not doing that?"

**Design decisions should be based on user data.** When you look at the history of UX, though the term itself was coined only in 1993, the discipline itself was heavily influenced, and born out of traditional architecture: With the explosion of the web and digital, and with all this building of digital spaces and experiences online, UX became more prominent. But the original intention and value has stayed the same. **UX is about making things work**, not only pretty. What good is a pretty building if it's going to collapse?

<br/>

### Misconceptions about UX in Gov

Despite the value of understanding the people who use the products or services brings to projects, misconceptions about UX persist, especially in public service. These are some [misconceptions](https://judepark.com/essay/ux-in-gov) about UX:

- "UX is just about making things look pretty."
- "UX is only about the technology or the interface."
- "UX is only relevant for the private sector."
- "UX in government is only about improving websites and forms."
- "Governments cannot prioritize UX due to budget constraints."
- "UX should be the responsiblity of a sole designer."
- "UX is a checkmark exercise"

I could probably spend all day refuting each and every one of these statements I have personally heard from senior leadership in the Government of Canada. And fighting these misconceptions has certainly been a big pain point for me and my career. It's important to realize that UX focuses on service, functionality, and the holistic experience; not merely about the visual aesthetics or the technology. Contrary to popular belief, UX isn't solely relevant to the private sector. It is arguably more critical in government where services are irreplaceable. UX should not be a checkmark exercise; it requires strategic investment and expertise in the discipline.

<br/>

### Final Thoughts

Doing UX "right" can be complex, especially in a bureaucratic system such as the government. You need the right senior leadership who understands the size of effort and quality of work that goes into successfully implementing UX into existing government processes. There needs to be a fundamental talent attraction and managmenet transformation in the Government of Canada, if it wishes to maintain understanding the people it services a priority. UX will only become more critical and central in the future, with new technologies and policies. We must ensure our policies are human-centered.
 
As a government, we should rely on data to make informed decisions and that includes data on the experience of people who rely on our services and products. It is a critical piece to making sure our policies serve human needs and pain points.

The act of exploring these questions about the user experience and answering them, anticipating people's behaviors through data and evidence - that is the work of user experience research and design. And as a government body, we need the support from our leaders and resources in talent, tools, policies and processes to do it right for Canadians and beyond. The people that we serve deserve good services.

### How UX Helps with Projects

The work of understanding the users can look at many different aspects to help out a government project:

- Collection and analysis of quantiative data and qualitative data related to the user group(s).
- Navigating cognitive biases and barriers to access, fairness, equity between a service and the people using them.
- Leveraging human psychology to understand user behaviours.
- Assess the quality of usability in a Technology and/or interface.
- Increase qualitative values or beliefs towards an organization's brand and identity.
- Increase trustworthiness of an organization in the minds of people.
- Evidence-based data on how services and policies affect the lives of people.
- Holistically understanding the experience individuals have with an organization, its services, and products.

The purpose of UX in government is clear: to ensure services fulfill their intended purpose effectively. UX evaluates usability, leverages human psychology, addresses cognitive biases, and fosters trustworthinessâ€”all to enhance the user journey
