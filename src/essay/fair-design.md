What is Fair Design?
Introduction
Fair Design is a design principle that aims to ensure each social groups have the access necessary to receive the intended service of a product or innovation. The framework gauges social privileges of the users, and measures access by their proximity to intended information. Design guides our access to information. Yet due to unfair design practices, products and services may unintentionally build barriers and discriminate social groups. The goal of fair design is to proactively prepare for a future that is inclusive, and leaves no one behind.

Etymology of "fair"

History of Fair Design
Fair Design was conceptualized in 2018, in my research of user experience design as a discipline and pedagogy. With assistance from Dr. Olivier St.Cyr of University of Toronto, I created a reading course titled “Fair Design – Ethical Frameworks for Inclusive Design Principles”, where I published an essay and design methodology that can be used by others to begin incorporating fair design practices into their product or service design.

Fair Design is inspired by the frameworks of Accessibility Design (Designing for Disability), Inclusive Design (Designing for Diversity) and Universal Design (Designing for All). Fair Design also adopts mandates from design activisms groups across the globe, to understand specific needs of social groups. The output of the fair design framework is a product or service that spark pleasing yet accessible experiences to target social groups.

Framework
Principles of Fair Design
Value-Driven Goals – Define the value to be delivered through the product or service.
Representative Teams with Identities – Formalize a team with self-identifying members of the community in which the product will be designed for
Iterative CoDesign – Invite users from the community for codesign session in the design process
Design Process:
Interact – Immerse all members of the team, even the decision-makers into the real world to uncover the authenticities
Involve – Invite users of all levels and accessibility needs to track points of view in order to find common trajectory of value delivery system
Invest – Invest in prototypes by prioritizing outcomes that will satisfy all potential users
Methodology
The Fair Design Kit
CoDesign studio sessions, or Cooperative Design comes from Participatory Design movement from the 1970’s. The aim of CoDesign is to involve members from the public to the creative practice of design. This ensures that real users are not only consulted in order to gain data, but that they take active roles in voicing their concerns and their experiences to interact with the designers as much as possible. \
CoDesign studios should be an active part of each iterative loop in the Fair Design method, with care taken to invite members of different racial, ethnic, class identities with varying accessibility needs. CoDesign studios should always be: Inclusive, Community-Driven, and Safe Spaces. In order to encourage innovations to foster, truly collaborative and safe spaces are mandatory to the creative process. CoDesign Studio Facilitator should be trained in standardized methods in order to facilitate and manage a room full of strangers to work together collaborative to come up with ideas. Keep in mind that since CoDesign studios invite members outside of the organization and institutions, there is always a danger of unpredictable attendees. The studio sessions should be ran by professionals who can properly mediate unexpected situations with proper de-escalation techniques for internal quarrels. Therefore, the safety of all members involved during the studio session should be emphasized. Some equipment needed would be an open space with chairs and walls where people can post sticky notes.
Fair Design Exercises
Deconstructing the Boxed-In User Duration: 30-60 minutes. Materials needed: Sticky Notes Description: This exercise involves techniques of scenario application to redefine uses of a product that may have obvious or set use cases in mind. Give examples of well known products or services that exist today and ask the participants to create personas and think of scenarios where this product can be used for. Apply accessibility design techniques to decontextualize the product’s use case for a user with sensory impairments. Ask the participants to create personas again and think of scenarios for the second time, but with restrictions in visibility, auditory, or mental illness difficulties that could act as a barrier between the user and the product. Aim of Exercise: To allow designers to realize that persona or proto-persona creations are often boxed-in to certain type of users, and introduce critical thinking techniques to encompass a greater sensibility towards the meaning of a “user”, and redefine the user under various contexts outside the boxed-in scenarios.

Immersive Experience Duration: 2-3 weeks of planning, 2+ hours of activity Materials needed: Voluntary organizations with access to community Description: This exercise involves techniques applied at Pixar. A field trip or immersive experiences are considered a mandatory part for animators who about to enter into a 2-3 year animation project that tells the story of a target culture or community. Designers need to get out of the building and immerse themselves in the environments of their users to gain an intimate understanding. Unlike ethnographic research, which relies on the designer to observe and often times not engage with their participants, this immersive experience trip allows full engagement and interaction between designers and user groups, by inviting designers to spaces where their users are. Aim of Exercise: To allow designers to realize to gain experience within the target community that their design is aiming for.

Imitation of Lived-In Experience of Persona Duration: 5-10 minutes Materials needed: Phones, devices, sticky notes Description: This exercise involves techniques from theatre. It is to engage the participants to pretend to be a persona created from previous exercises. Participants will be paired up with one being the observer, the other being the user persona. The persons will have one or more identity trait that will define how they are able to interact with their device, whether it be an physical need (eg. Hard-of seeing) or mental need (eg. Stress, Time-restraint, ect.) The participants will be asked to engage with the device of choice as if they are the personas, and asked to do simple task (eg. Calling a friend). They must navigate through the system as their persona while their partner actively observe their actions and track their decision made within the product. Partners will be asked to reflect to each other about how they interacted with the system changed, given the role of the persona, and write down their learnings on sticky notes. Aim of Exercise: To allow designers to conceptualize actual use of their product in the real-world.

Future Steps
The value of Fair Design is unhindered access to information by all. Fair Design works to dismantle homogeneity that exist to threaten creativity and positive innovations for the future. User experience should be a practice that is embraced by everyone, not only the designers. Design can be rooted in prejudice and ignorance, and in our future where there will be more technological innovations and information available than ever before, access to information must be a right redeemable by any human, despite their identity or community. Elitism in the design world kills creativity, and we must design with inclusivity and fairness in mind from the very start, rather than teaching the importance of marginalized experiences as an afterthought or going back to designs and fixing products to become accessible. Fair Design hope to provoke the question: In our advancements of technology, are we socially progressing as a society? The goal of the design kit and the exercises in Fair Design is to set people on a different direction. Designers have more power than ever before to create positive impact in their line of work. The role of designers is not confined to usability, profit-driven research or interface design. It is the responsibility of the designer to provide access to information to the users who need and deserve it. Access to information is a right, and in this way designers become ethical bridge makers that allows the user to gain the information they need. Poorly equipped designers who fall back on mainstream user experience methodologies to build services for the homogenous users will not able to thrive in our ever-shifting society, where values of users change over time. It will be more crucial than ever to implement ethics-based approaches to design moving forward. Future steps for Fair Design will include consultation with expert leaders in the field of design to make the methodology a reality, and to create an open community where as many marginal voices can be captured and amplified in the making of the Fair Design. A future goal of Fair Design would be to incorporate ethical impacts of design to be a main disciplinary component of user experience education.

Understanding Fair Design: Precision, Ethics, and Diversity
In the ever-evolving field of design, professionals must continually reexamine their roles, approaches, and impacts on the world. Jesus Gorriti highlights a critical gap in the comprehension and application of design principles among designers and service providers. This essay explores the essential components of fair design, the need for precision and accuracy, the ethical considerations, and the importance of managing diversity within the design process.

The Role of Designers and the Importance of Precision and Accuracy
Designers are tasked with creating solutions that not only meet aesthetic and functional requirements but also address broader social and ethical implications. However, many designers struggle to understand the full scope of their responsibilities. Precision and accuracy in design are fundamental yet often overlooked. According to Gorriti, many designers do not fully grasp what their actions entail in the real world. Precision ensures that the design meets specific criteria and functions as intended, while accuracy ensures that these criteria are met consistently and reliably.

In "Design is a Job," Mike Monteiro emphasizes that design is not just about creating visually appealing products but about solving problems and meeting users' needs effectively. This perspective underscores the importance of precision and accuracy. Without these qualities, designers risk producing work that is aesthetically pleasing but functionally deficient or ethically questionable.

Building a Fair Design Practice
Fair design involves creating solutions that are equitable, inclusive, and just. To grow fair design as a practice and business, designers must address two critical questions. First, how can fair design be applied in practice? This involves developing steps and methodologies that integrate fairness into the design process. Designers need to trial, test, and research their approaches to find evidence-based methods that work.

Second, who will pay for fair design? This question addresses the market demand for ethical and fair design solutions. Designers must identify and understand their audience to create products and services that people genuinely care about and are willing to invest in.

Implementing Fair Design
Building a fair design practice requires a commitment to ethical principles and a willingness to challenge the status quo. Designers must define their non-negotiables—core values and standards that they will not compromise on. This might include prioritizing user welfare over purely commercial interests or ensuring accessibility for all users.

Effective communication is also crucial. As Monteiro suggests, if a concept can be easily Googled, it lacks the depth and originality needed to make a meaningful impact. Designers should strive to offer unique insights and solutions that go beyond superficial fixes.

Ethical Considerations in Design
Ethics play a pivotal role in the design process. Sheila Jasanoff's talk on "Ethical Futures: Imagination and Governance in an Unequal World" provides a framework for understanding how ethics intersect with design. Jasanoff outlines three modes of managing diversity: coexistence, cosmopolitanism, and constitutionalism. Each mode offers a different approach to integrating diverse perspectives and addressing ethical challenges.

Modes of Managing Diversity
Coexistence: This mode advocates for a live-and-let-live approach, managing borders and promoting an ethics of conflict resolution. It recognizes differences without necessarily integrating them.

Cosmopolitanism: This mode emphasizes hospitality and accommodating differences without enforcing a universal standard. It promotes respect and understanding across diverse groups.

Constitutionalism: This mode involves adopting common norms and integrating differences within a shared framework. It promotes an ethics of integration, aiming for a cohesive and unified approach to diversity.

The lack of a unified approach to diversity management can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings. Designers must navigate these complexities and develop strategies that consider multiple perspectives and ethical considerations.

Intersectionality and Professional Ramifications
Understanding intersectionality—the interconnectedness of social categorizations such as race, gender, and class—is crucial for ethical design. This understanding helps designers create products and services that address the needs of diverse user groups and avoid perpetuating biases or inequalities.

Conclusion
Building a fair design practice involves more than just technical skills; it requires a deep understanding of ethics, precision, and diversity. Designers must continually educate themselves on ethical considerations and strive for precision and accuracy in their work. By doing so, they can create solutions that are not only effective and functional but also equitable and just. As Jesus Gorriti and Mike Monteiro suggest, the future of design lies in our ability to address these challenges and embrace the complexities of our ever-changing world.



The “Boxed-In” User that Designers Should Avoid in Persona Creation
March 2018
The story usually goes something like this:

With post-it notes all around, a group of designers sit tightly in a well-lit room. After brainstorming for product ideas and reviewing the data available at hand, they ask them themselves, “Who are the users for this product?”

1

They rock their foreheads. Until finally someone breaks the silence, “I know, how about Brenda. She is a x years old and she is a y with z as her main concerns.”

With gratitude for an input, the rest of the designers agree that Brenda is the ultimate user for this product. As a proto-persona, Brenda throughout the evolution of the product changes in age, profession and concerns. However, the rest of her identity relatively stays the same. The product launches, and “Brenda”s all around the world cheer in admiration for the product built for all the “Brenda”s in the world. Success! Right?

No. Not in my opinion.

The product may be deemed a success in the eyes of the company’s leaders — it is usable and it is nice-looking. But potential clients who were untouched by this product stay hidden in the radar. The company goes back to designing more products for more Brenda’s of the world.

Why do proto-personas around every design room sound so similar? Why wasn’t Brenda manufactured beyond age, profession and concern? Is that all there is to Brenda’s identity? Why did the persona creation stage not intensify?

This article will address these questions and look at our natural instincts in persona creation that generates the “boxed-in” user. This article will then argue how the boxed-in user can hurt the creative process.

Why did no one else chime in to manufacture Brenda to further develop her complexity?
When the first designer presented Brenda as one possible user for the product, the other designers did not challenge the source of Brenda. Brenda was an imaginary product from a single mind, perhaps with with remnants of real life people. The truth is: Brenda does not exist. She is as real as Santa Claus or Mary Poppins — visual imagery may appear in our heads when we think of these characters but they are nonetheless fictional. Brenda is limited to what the first designer’s experiences. It is quite possible that the product being developed will be useful for users who are outside of the the first designer’s experiences or associations, such as marginalized users.

Why did the persona creation stage not intensify?
Without proper research, you cannot challenge the existence of Brenda. Just as much as it is difficult to argue Brenda is the main user, it is equally difficult to justify why she isn’t the main user, without research. Brenda remains on the shelf as a fictional character in our head, until we are outside the building and interacting with a real-life person. Without each new observation, interview, and qualitative data source, Brenda cannot grow in complexity.

What value did Brenda actually bring to the product?
Brenda brought nothing in value for the designers, other than allowing them to have self-fulfilling affirmation that what they were doing had a purpose, and giving them a visual imagery in their head whenever they thought of the “user”. Brenda did not add complexities to the product, nor did she give verification or justification to the features the product ended up having.

It is also important to note, Brenda was a boxed-in user. Brenda was a user that fits the bill of what “normal” means in society: fully able-bodied, generic majority race, and no marginalized experiences that defined who she was. Throughout the time that it took you to read this article, what did “Brenda” look like in your head? Did she have any physical attributes? Was she a visual minority? Did she have targeted experiences that marginalized her, other than her sex as a woman? What did Brenda struggle with in her life? Perhaps it was her battle with mental illness. Or she has a sick father she is taking care of. Experiences that are invisible make up who Brenda’s core of her identity, and it propels her to choose the kind of products or services she chooses to interact with. Experiences of an individual, whether it is visible or invisible, cannot be tapped into without power of qualitative research gathering that helps to unearth and discover an experience.

We as designers, or as members of the unequal society, cannot be expected to operate without bias because the system in which we live in is corrupt with dominant ideals of what a true “person” is. Research is crucial today more than ever for product development, because the very people who sit at the designer’s table, the industry tables, the executives’ tables are so unequally balanced. Limited in our experiences, we must leave our building and seek out real persons in the world who will be affected by our product. A group of designers cannot be trusted to think of the user for a product alone. Without research, what they end up creating will only be the boxed-in user.

“If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.”

I believe designers have an ethical duty to properly speak and interact and hire those with experiences drastically different from ours. We can certainly start acknowledging our limitations to reduce the margins for error, however we cannot ever start with certainty, because certainty does not truly exist in our line of work.


Racially safe spaces may not mean much to some people. It may sound obsolete, archaic and out of date. All the more so in 2017. Afterall, there is no such thing as racial prejudice in today’s times, right?

Well, that’s wrong.

If you are a person who have ever been the racial minority or token person of color in a public space, you may have noticed the effects that it has had on you. From how you behave and conduct yourself in front of others, to even perhaps being overly mindful about associating yourself with certain racial stereotypes.

To feel racially unsafe is to be painfully aware of being the only token person in a room. It means carrying the burden of being sole representation of an entire group. In a completely or relatively homogenous group, such as a business meeting full of white colleagues for example, it can be difficult to feel racially safe when you are the only person of color in the room. This marries well to the example of being the only woman in the room. Although not racial, your gender identity also puts you at risk of feeling unsafe. This is why identities and social privileges can have a deep effect on you and your abilities to be physically and mentally safe in an environment, and thus how you perform at work (or more importantly, how you are perceived to perform at work).

So how can we design racially safe spaces in the workplace, and ensure all members of a team can feel safe in representing who they are?

To design racially safe spaces, what is helpful is to have all members of the team trained to be quietly cognizant about the lack of diversity in the room. Note the word quietly – voicing racial injustices or bringing attention to the only person of color can make everyone in the room uncomfortable, the same way forcing the only person of non-abled body to speak about their experiences, or treating the only person of the other gender in a different way from the rest is unprofessional. I say quietly cognizant, to prevent individuals from altering their behavior or becoming overtly conscious to all injustices or inequalities in the workplace 1. Becoming mindful to racial inequities does not need to be an uncomfortable experience, but a natural life path towards developing your collaborative and communication skills with people from different walks of life.

Racially safe spaces are spaces where each person in the room, regardless of their race, feels safe to express who they are without fear of retribution. This should be achieved, not by erasing the race of every member in the room (an impractical approach) but by being cognizant of our racial identities as a intuitive part of each person’s identity and accepting them as who they are.

When I look at North American history, how racial identities have progressed throughout the years strikes me as very odd. We went from using racial differences to fuel the foundations for capitalism and the betterment of the white race, to banning racism and making it taboo. Racism, essentially, was outlawed overnight. This quick transition failed to teach people how to treat or view different racial identities today in the globalized world. Most of our gut reaction to racial identities other than our own are indeed prejudiced – because the legacy of racism continues on today. No single person can overcome centuries of prejudice that is culturally embedded in our society alone.

We went straight from pointing out racial identities to ignoring race altogether. But your racial identity is a part of you – it is visible. It is one the first characteristic about you that people notice about you, and it contributed to who you are today, just like ethnic, gender, sexuality, class or any other social identities make up who we are.

Starting from a place that acknowledges our history and who we are and how different our experiences are, and being compassionate not dismissive, is the first step into creating racially safe environments in the workplace. The next step is up to you to go out and become educated. To choose more knowledge, not ignorance.

Because addressing each and every inequalities in the workplace is a mountainous amount of work that can only be acheived by everyone’s participation.


A question came to me in light of allegations against celebrities who sexually abuse their victims. From Harvey Weinstein to Bill Cosby, from R. Kelly to Michael Jackson, the social discussions surrounding powerful men and their crimes has been very revealing in the last couple of years.

One thing that is consistently true across all these stories is that victims often choose silence. And we know from empirical research how damaging that silence can be for the victims, years and decades following the event. Sometimes their whole lives.

Technology offers people instant reach to others, and can help encourage them to share their stories annonymously.

So how do we design channels that are safe, free from judgement, and offers support and aid for those who have suffered or is suffering from sexual abuse?

The Scope of My Research Question
I don’t want to focus on proving or disproving sexual abuse, because the process to validate one’s abuse is incredibly stressful for the victims.

Competitive analysis or Environmental Scan or What is Out there Now
What Sexual Abuse Is
Your brain physically is changed from abuse
They can’t give a straight answer because we as society is not dealt or equipped to handle grey - sexual abuse/seduction does not feel black and white, right or wrong to both the perpetrator and the victim.
You can feel good from the sex, even as a victim (this is a powerful part)







Fair Design: How to Design for Diversity in Social Privileges
 Andre Da Loba 
"If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design."
- Ralf Speth

During my masters, a founder spoke about her failures that made me decide I wanted to study fairness in design.

She had created app that lets parents find babysitters based on their location. A standard practice in any geo-location feature, is to default the view settings by locality. However, after a few years she noticed a pain point in her users: Babysitters who lived in marginalized or remote areas were not getting jobs.

Unintentionally, she had promoted babysitters who lived in richer neighborhoods to be matched with willing customers. User research informed her that the babysitters who lived farther away were more than willing to travel for work, and babysitters from undesirable neighborhods were no less qualified than the babysitters who lived in upper-class neighborhoods.

Did it make sense to set the default settings to view babysitters closest to you? Was that the most important criteria for parents looking for babysitters? Was the app discriminating users based on where they lived?

How do you solve a social issue through design?

This sparked a passion in me to try to design products deliver fair service. Technology pervades our lives in every aspect, and I wanted to create a fairer and a more sustainable future, by designing new products and services right1. When we elevate our collective understanding of ethical designs and fair access, we are better equipped for good designs.

Designers Shape The Future
A designer is someone who invents or develops something with intention. I believe designers build the world we have come to know and they will continue to shape our expectations. As such, they set the bar of what is socially acceptable or not. I hold designers accountable for at least being mindful of their biases. Beyond accessibility, inclusive or ethical design practices, there is a lack of understanding among designers when it comes to social privileges2. I wanted to create a way for designers to first realize not all persons are born equal, and learn how design can actively solve the inequalities in users who have different social privileges.

How can we design fair products?

There are various design methodologies and tools that either prevents harmful design practices or can fix bad designs. Participatory or Co-Design frameworks, Design Thinking, all work to incorporate user feedbacks earlier in product strategy to prevent creating an unusuable products and services. Accessibility and inclusive design frameworks, and user testings can make products and services become more accessible for a particular group of users.

But users are not just "users" who interacts with an interface. They are human, with identities and social privileges that can determine how they interact with a product or service. When designers are mindful about the fact that not all users that come to their products will not have an equal experience

People are not Test Dummies
People are not test dummies, mass produced and homogenous.

For my thesis I researched design methodologies (eg. Design Thinking vs. Participatory Design vs. Inclusive Design, ect.), looking at their history, applications, strengths and weaknesses. I wanted to answer the question: "How do you solve a social issue through design?" My 50 page paper really just boiled down to three points:

Designers, like all humans, are inherently biased due to the limitations of our own experiences.
Designers should not accidently produce something harmful.
Designers need a way to measure how accessible their products are to users of different social privileges in order to determine their social accessibility.
Fully acknowledging "right" is subjective, making something right is ethically a difficult concept. ↩
Social Privileges include identities that is considered advantageous in society based on social class, gender, age, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, accents, political group, physical and mental abilities, height, physical appearance, ect. ↩
