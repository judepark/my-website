"A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business."
- Henry Ford

As a designer..
I will include the experiences of marginalized groups into my design process.

I shall not hide, avoid or diminish experiences of others1.

In order to avoid creating products and services that discriminate, bias or neglect, the people I am designing for will always guide me in my design.

I shall reject projects that will result in harm to the public.

I will respect the privacy of individuals, groups and collectives, and design to protect personal data.

I will incorporate lenses of privilege2 when exercising my design decisions.

With my seat at the table, I will bring voices that can empower us to make inclusive and smart decisions.

Designers Create Our Future
Designer to me in broadest term is someone who creates or invents or develops anything with intention. I believe designers build the world we come to know and they will continue to shape our expectations and outcomes of how the world functions. As such, we can set the bar of what is acceptable or not. Diversity is the answer to survival not only in the biological sense but nowawadays in this political sphere it is how corporations can stay lasting. I don't mean the fake type of diversity where all the PR photos of racialized employees while a group of white or white-adjacent powerful men sit in at the board of directors level.

Pillars of Design
